Starting the Dashboard in Background:
- Change directory to your KlovitClient folder Using `cd` command, Example: `cd KlovitClient` 
- To run KlovitClient, use `pm2 start index.js --name "klovitclient"`
- To view logs, run `pm2 logs klovitclient`

Making the dashboard runs on startup:
- Make sure your dashboard is running in the background with the help of [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2)
- You can check if KlovitClient is running in background with `pm2 list`
- Once you confirmed that KlovitClient is running in background, you can create a startup script by running `pm2 startup` and `pm2 save`
- Note: Supported init systems are `systemd`, `upstart`, `launchd`, `rc.d`
- To stop your KlovitClient from running in the background, use `pm2 unstartup`

To stop a currently running KlovitClient instance, use `pm2 stop klovitclient`
